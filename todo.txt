TODO:
Metals have all been added, some of them need better sprites.

*in progress: Alloy mixer: stores dusts, uses them to alloy or fill a bottle
Automatic Lurcher: uses ironpulling to extract dust from metal (leaves stone)
Hammer: hammers ingots and ores into dust
Automatic Coinshot: uses steelpushing to automatically hammer
Hops: store in barrel to make alcohol?
Copper clips

The Alloying minigame: enter the ratio of two dusts to combine in the alloy mixer.
    This ratio is random for each world for each alloy, with upper and lower bounds.
    If the ratio is wrong, you obtain a "failed mixture".
        "Flawed" if the ratio was way off
        "Almost correct" if the ratio was close
        Tells you which alloy was used too much
    Maybe books or named paper in chest loot tells you this
    When a dust is successfully made, ratios are locked in
